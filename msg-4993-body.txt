via
Github to Heroku. I request you to share the Heroku dev environment &
Github access details, so that we can start exploring the same.

Meantime, just wanted to understand our readiness in terms user stories to
start the sprint 1 development by mid of next week. I would be in a
position to share my HLD document in next 2 days time for your review.

Please revert with your comments...

Regards,
Dhinakarr.
